      <h2>1. Background </h2>
      <p>Non-speaking is the medical term to classify those who are not able to use spoken language to communicate. However, they can still use other forms of communication. Typically, they use Augmentative Alternative Communication (AAC) to communicate with their caregivers. For the disabled, AAC intervention led to 89% of them demonstrating gains in speech production. In addition, AAC methods have also shown to improve the quality of lives for patients with voice loss. [1]


        To empathize with the non-speaking community, I partnered with organizations supporting individuals with Autism, Down Syndrome, Dementia, and Motor Neuron Disease (MND). Interviews with speech therapists and teaching staff provided deeper insights into current communication tools, their effectiveness, and suitability for each group. This approach helped identify strengths and limitations of existing AAC tools, guiding potential improvements.
        
        For the individuals I have met, with Autism, Down syndrome and Dementia, they use forms of low-tech AAC to communicate with their caregivers. This is due to them being able to utilise various forms of physical movements. On the other hand, individuals with MND tend to use high-tech AAC to communicate due to their limited physical ability. Although low-tech AAC may give the impression to be slower and less effective compared to high-tech AAC, interviews with speech therapists highlighted that the choice of communication tool largely depends on personal suitability and preference. Therefore, I chose MND as the primary target group, given their potential to benefit significantly from AI-enhanced AAC and their dissatisfaction with current tools.
        
        This report explores how AI-powered AAC systems, in particular screen-based eye tracking and Mixed Reality platforms, can enhance communication for individuals with MND.
