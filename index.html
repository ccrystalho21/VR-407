      <p>Non-speaking individuals use Augmentative Alternative Communication (AAC) to communicate with caregivers. AAC interventions have shown benefits, but limitations exist in usability and daily integration.</p>
      <p>To empathize with the non-speaking community, I partnered with organizations supporting individuals with Autism, Down Syndrome, Dementia, and Motor Neurone Disease. Interviews with speech therapists and teaching staff provided deeper insights into current communication tools, their effectiveness, and suitability for each group.</p>

By measuring reflections from the eyeball and tracking the boundary between the pupil and iris, it calculates eye rotation to determine input. <sup>[1]</sup></p>

                        <strong>Speak Button:</strong> A "Speak" button allows users to have the generated text read aloud by a synthesized voice for effective communication.

                    Sunlight has a critical impact on data captured by the eye tracker as infrared radiation from sunlight can cause corneal reflection signals to be hard to maintain and detect.<sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup> Additionally, sunlight reflecting off the skin, or eyes into the photo detectors can be mistaken by the eye-tracker as a corneal reflection, causing a reduction in spatial accuracy. <sup>[1]</sup>

                <p><strong><u>Slow communication by TA as TA tends to mistype letters occasionally.</u></strong> This is due to the natural, rapid movements of the eyes called saccades, as well as eye drifts—small, involuntary shifts away from the fixation point—causing errors with fixations to select a particular letter.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
                <p>Additionally, eye trackers exhibit systematic errors, the disparity between the average gazepoint location and actual fixation by TA, causing a lack in accuracy. Eye movement data is inherently noisy, causing the calibration to deteriorate over the course of use per time. <sup>[1]</sup></p>
